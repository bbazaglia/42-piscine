# 42-piscine
Codes developed during the intensive training in C at 42 Piscine. 

C00 was focused in learning how a function works. 
Using the "write" function, we created functions to print a char, the alphabet and numbers. 
The exercises 00 to 04 are very basic. 
The exercises 05 and 06 are a bit more challenging, with the usage of nested loops.
The exercise 07 is a challenge, in which we had to convert integers with multiple digits to char. It was also the first usage of a recursive function.

C01 was focused in learning how a pointer works.
The exercises 00 and 01 are very basic.
The exercise 02 is a swap function.
The exercises 03 and 04 are about pointers arithmetic.
The exercise 05 is a function to print a string using the write function.
The exercise 06 is a function to get the length of a string.
The exercises 07 and 08 are more complex, envolving sorting methods.

C02 was focused in reproducing the behaviours of the functions from the standard C Library.
The exercises 00 to 06 reproduced the following functions: strcpy, strncpy, isalpha, isdigit, tolower, toupper and isprint.
The exercise 07 is a function that converts only the lowercase characters to uppercase.
The exercise 08 is a function that converts only the uppercase characters to lowercase.
The exercise 09 is bit more difficult: we had to create a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word and transforms all other letters to lowercase.
The exercise 10 reproduced the behaviour of the function strlcpy.
The exercise 11 is a challenge. We had to create a function that displays characters that arenâ€™t printable in the shape of hexadecimals (lowercase), preceeded by a "backslash".

C03 was also focused in reproducing the behaviours of the functions from the standard C Library.
The functions reproduced were: strcmp, strncmp, strcat, strncat, strstr and strlcat.

C04 was a revision task.
The exercises 00 to 02 reproduced the following functions: strlen, pustr and putnbr.
The exercise 03 is a version of the atoi function.
The exercise 04 is a challenge, in which we had to display a number in different base systems.

C05 was focused in recursive functions and math concepts.
The functions were created to get the factorial number, a number to it's power, the fibonacci sequence, if a number has a squareroot, if a number is prime and to find the next prime number.

C06 was focused in command line arguments.
The functions were created to print the program name, print the parameters, print the parameters in reverse order and print the parameters sorted according to the ASCII table.
